    We are so incredibly honored to announce that we earned 5th place overall out of nearly 50 teams at the <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/offices/education/centers/kennedy/technology/nasarmc.html" target="_blank"> NASA Robotic Mining Competition</a> , a huge leap forward from our 32nd finish last year! We have won first place for our System Engineering paper and second for our System Engineering presentation! 
</p>
<p class="blog_text">
    This has been our first year applying system engineering principles to our robot design process, and we really threw ourselves into doing it well. It has paid off in more ways than one, as this year's robot had the most successful mining run in team history.
</p>
<p class="blog_text">
    We would like to thank Dr. Sunniva Refsnes Collins for reading and advising us on our paper, Morgan Hendry for guiding us as we navigated the systems engineering process, and our advisor Dr. Richard Bachmann for mentoring us throughout the year. He has taught us more than we could ever learn in the classroom, and has dedicated himself to enabling us to do our best work.
